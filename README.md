# Bargaining with (more) common priors in the field


Several theoretical models have shown that bargaining can break down if parties have different priors about the probability of winning at trial. We test this theory in the field by studying labor conflicts. First, we run an experiment providing information about likely outcomes at trial to a treatment group of potential plaintiffs in firing lawsuits. that includes both plaintiff and defendants.  We show that they update expectations in the direction of the information and it makes it closer to the employers expectation, and that they settle more compared to a control group. Second, we show that providing information to only the worker has much smaller effects. Third, we exploit a discontinuity in the information provision rule and show that leads (almostotherwise identical workers) parties to receive different predicted payments. We show that workers who receive  that get information with a higher predicted payment amount to the worker update their priors upward (and come closer together) and settle at higher rates. more, consistent with bargaining models of bargaining with common priors (or models increasing the bargaining power of the weakest player XXX) decreases bargaining impasses. Finally, we show that providing predictive information that is too far off from their own priors makes them update expectations less, and lowers the effect of the information on settlement rates. This suggests that they have private information on their own case and disregard information that is less consistent with their information. All in all we show that information provided to both parties increases settlement more.

# RScripts and Do-Files

You will see there are subdirectories for Raw and Clean Data, and for RScripts and DoFiles used to generate content. RScripts are always run from the RScripts directory, while DoFiles are run from the experiment directory by declaring a global variable.  All scripts have the name of the figure or table they are generating.

File cleaning processes are generally done in R and take Raw data as an input and have DB data as an output. However, some slight variable recoding is done in STATA in some cases when running regressions. 

# Workflow 

We share all our work through github, and update the Overleaf project through Dropbox.
